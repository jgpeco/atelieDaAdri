# AteliÃª da Adri
A catalog site created with React, NextJS and NetllifyCMS. 

## Motivation
The client asked for a simple and unexpensive solution to showcase her work in social medias. The client didn't need an e-commerce site and, since it is a small local business, she asked to reduce the cost to the minimun to maintain the application. My solution was to remove the backend of the app, this way we didn't need to hire a VPS or a cloud service. I wanted to learn how a SSG worked, so I used nextJS to create the static pages of the site. Its dynamic route pagination suited pretty well my need to have a page for each product without standard backend routes and a database. NetlifyCMS will be used for the client to add the products herself, everytime a new product is added, NetlifyCMS creates it in a markdown file in this github project page. Since the data written by the client doesn't have any sensible information, it is ok for it to be public in the md files of my repo. I've also created a responsive and mobile-friendly unique theme with SASS to match the style of her business.

In this project I've learned a lot on how to work with SSG, headless CMS's, the structure and language behind markdown content and configuration of a YML file. I've also understand more about how react behave on some unconvetional structures (learning how to get the dynamic page URL to filter a product was fun!) and what is possible to achieve without a backend to hold the ground for the application.
